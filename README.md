### **Data Science For EveryOne Mentorship and BootCamp Program** 

**Data Science For Everyone** Program is [LuxDevHQ](https://twitter.com/LuxDevHQ) program that aims to make the field of data science accessible and understandable to a wide range of people, regardless of their background or expertise.

In the program, we recognize that data science has the potential to bring valuable insights and solutions to various domains and industries, and therefore, it is important to demystify and democratize this field. 

Data science involves extracting knowledge and insights from large and complex datasets using various techniques, such as data mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Traditionally, data science has been associated with specialized skills and technical expertise, requiring a strong background in mathematics, statistics, programming, and domain knowledge.

This Free Bootcamp emphasizes the need for clear communication, intuitive visualizations, and user-friendly tools that enable individuals to explore and analyze data without requiring an in-depth understanding of complex algorithms or programming languages. 

Overall,  we are aiming to bridge the gap between technical experts and non-technical professionals, enabling a broader audience to leverage the power of data and make informed decisions based on evidence and insights derived from data analysis.

Week 1 Projects: 

**Question 1).**  Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that.

So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? Like, what steps would you take to create a machine learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?

**Question 2).** Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?

**Week 4 Article:** The Complete Guide to Time Series Models

**Week 4 Project:**

Using the Craigslist Vehicles Dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbaabuharun/craigslist-vehicles), we'd like you to create a Time-Series Model following the approach outlined below.

**Here are the key steps:**
- Start by addressing missing values in the dataset. You can handle this by filling in missing values with the median for numerical columns and the mode for categorical columns.
- Ensure that the data types of the columns are appropriate. Specifically, make sure to convert the 'posting_date' column to a datetime data type.
- Utilize the 'posting_date' column to create a datetime index for the dataset. This will facilitate the analysis of temporal patterns.
- With clean data, explore it using various visualizations and statistical analysis techniques. This step is crucial for understanding temporal patterns, identifying seasonal trends, and analyzing demand-supply dynamics by region and vehicle type.
- Build the time-series chart.
- Finally, create a GitHub Repository and push your work there, also document your process through each of the steps and demonstrate your understanding by implementing them on the dataset.

As a lead data engineer at Data Science East Africa, you are responsible for building a data engineering pipeline to move weather data from a public API to Azure Synapse Analytics. You will then use Power BI to access the data from Azure Synapse Analytics and create a modern dashboard. 

  (i). What are the best practices for moving data from a public API to a data lake?
  
  (ii). How can we ensure the security and reliability of the data pipeline?
  
  (iii). Implement this project, optimize your process, and create a GitHub repository where you will document all the processes including Screenshort, and a short video explaining the whole process. 


2). Project 5.

In week 4, we performed time series modelling on the Craigslist vehicles dataset, which is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbaabuharun/craigslist-vehicles. This project builds on that work. You will need to download the dataset, copy the data using SQL to a local PostgreSQL database, move the data from your local database to Snowflake, perform data transformation with DBT (data build tool), and use your preferred data visualization tool to create a report and dashboard.
